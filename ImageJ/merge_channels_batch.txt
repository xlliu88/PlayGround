//This is a ImageJ script to merge YFP (in Green), mCherry (in Magenta)
//the target folder should be organized in thus a way that,
//     1. there're only images of three individule channels (YFP, mCherry, BrightFiele)
//     2. ch00 = YFP channel (in green); 
//        ch01 = mCherry channel (in Magenta); 
//        ch02 = BrightField Channel (in gray)
// output file name will be ended with "_merged.tif"
