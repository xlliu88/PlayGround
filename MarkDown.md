# This is a test for MarkDown

It is **sooo** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

*Once* you get the hang of it, you just:

* Remember the basic syntax
* Write you doc
* Done!

Now you can be a wiz at this language and code up stuff like `console.writeline("Hello Markdown!");

Can't remember the language? **No Problem**!
